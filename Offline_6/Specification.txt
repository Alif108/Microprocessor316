# Atmega32 ADC 

Generate a variable voltage from 0 Volt to 3.5 Volt using a potentiometer. You will measure this voltage using ADC and display the voltage in the LCD segment. You will also continuously monitor the voltage using a voltmeter. You should use the DC voltmeter of Proteus. We will change the voltage using the pot and the reading of ADC from the LCD segment should be within 0.02Vto the value shown in the DC voltmeter
